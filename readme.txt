This is a professional Full Stack sample project demonstrating my abilities in Go, GraphQL, Postgres, Redis, and React Native with TypeScript.
It includes a functional backend with a GraphQL API, Redis caching, and Postgres integration, as well as a React Native frontend showing product list and add-product functionality.

Please note that this is a simplified sample for demonstration purposes. I have completed many more complex and professional projects that cannot be publicly shared due to confidentiality, but this project accurately represents my coding style, architecture, and full stack skills.
